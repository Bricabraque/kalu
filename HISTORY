# 04/19/2012, v0.1.5.1

- Preferences: option SyncDbsInTooltip could not be changed, fixed

- Preferences, Upgrades: added Check for pacman/kalu conflict. When enabled,
kalu will check if there's an upgrade of pacman likely to prevent the system
upgrade due to kalu's dependency to the current version of pacman (i.e. due to
API changes in libalpm).

If so, a button will be featured on the notification, to show a little message
about the reason for such a conflict, and how to perform the system upgrade.


# 04/14/2012, v0.1.5

- Now using automake & autoconf. (Hopefully) this shouldn't really change
much for most people, but if you don't care for kalu's updater and only want
to use kalu as update notifier, you can use option --disable-updater to configure.
You'll get a smaller binary, no second binary (kalu-dbus) nor dependency to
DBus/PolicyKit.

- When starting an external process to perform sysupgrade (or AUR upgrade), kalu
now waits for the process to end (being "busy" meanwhile), and runs another check
right after, to refresh its state. Closes #5.

- kalu always shipped with a man page, and recently a (this) changelog. Both can
both easily be read using menus Help & Change log.

- Added new option to customize icon used on notification: none, kalu's default,
or specifying a file to load the icon from. The icon will be shown full size, so
e.g. using /usr/share/pixmaps/kalu.png will uses kalu's icon at 48x48 (if
loading icon fails, silently falls back to kalu's default icon). Closes #6.

- kalu's updater always used /etc/pacman.conf (instead of whatever is set in
Preferences), fixed

- Parsing kalu.conf would report & stop on first error, now it ignores the line,
continues parsing, and report all errors (at once)

- kalu's updater: log messages longer than 1023 characters would be truncated, fixed

- Other minor fixes


# 03/26/2012, v0.1.4

- added section "Misc" under Preferences, with options to define action on
single- & double-click on systray icon: nothing, check for upgrades, system
upgrade, hide/show opened windows

- kalu updater: one can now click on columns to sort packages

- Preferences/Misc: option to disable sane sort indicator

- tooltip: now indicates if/how many dbs can be synchronized (regardless of
upgrades avability). Can be disabled via option under "Misc" in Preferences

- fixed possible memory leak if showing news failed on parsing

- showing Preferences without "Upgrade system" button enabled didn't have
PostSysUpgrade list disabled, fixed


# 03/20/2012, v0.1.3

- when saving Preferences, \n in templates wasn't resolved to newline (for
current run), fixed


# 03/18/2012, v0.1.2

- saving preferences if the folder (~/.config/kalu) did not already exist would
fail, fixed


# 03/11/2012, v0.1.1

- kalu-updater: environment variables were unset, which could cause issues on
some post_{install,upgrade} scripts, fixed

The sysupgrade is ran from kalu-dbus, which is automatically started through DBus.
When starting something, DBus does clear all environment variables, which could
cause problems is some scripts (e.g. mkinitcpio with autodetect hook, and the
lack of a PATH defined).
This is fixed by using a bash script to source /etc/profile (and therefore
restore a proper environment) before launching kalu-dbus
(See https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=136784)


# 03/06/2012, v0.1.0

- first stable release

- The menu "System upgrade" was always present and running kalu's system updater.
It now relies on the preferences for Upgrade notifications: only visible if
enabled, and starts either kalu's updater or the specified command line.
IOW those two (notifications' button & menu item) are 2 GUI elements of the same
feature.


# 03/03/2012, v0.0.6

- When performing a sysupgrade through kalu's updater, when (new) optionnal
dependencies were to be listed, kalu would crash. Note that "only" kalu (aka the
GUI) would crash, the updater part would still run fine and complete the upgrade,
as the log (pacman.log) would show. Still pretty bad, and fixed.

- When starting a sysupgrade, the message in the log (pacman.log) is now
"starting sysupgrade" to be more consistent with the message upon completion
("sysupgrade completed")


# 02/23/2012, v0.0.5

- added man page

- Preferences: added notification expiration delay


# 02/21/2012, v0.0.4.1

- kalu did not perform automatic checks (forgot to remove debugging comment), fixed


# 02/21/2012, v0.0.4

- added window Preferences to configure things

- checking the news did not report error on failure, fixed

- news were always checked regardless of settings, fixed

- templates were overly complicated, rewrote the whole thing


# 02/17/2012, v0.0.3

- when creating local copy of dbs, it would fail if there were folders (in sync/);
fixed (only copy files now)

- added basic command-line parser, and option -d/--debug to enable debug mode


# 02/15/2012, v0.0.2

- saving data (marking (AUR) watched packages, read news, managing (AUR) watched
packages) would silently failed if the folder did not exists (yet kalu acted as
if it had worked), which was pretty much always the case on a new installation, fixed

- template Title was missing $INS (total install size), fixed


# 02/14/2012, v0.0.1

- first release, still in development phase
