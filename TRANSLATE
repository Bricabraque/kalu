TRANSLATIONS

Starting with 1.4.0 kalu supports internationalization. One can create a new
translation following these steps :

1. Either get the latest tarball of kalu's source code and extract it, or clone
the git repo :
    git clone https://github.com/jjk-jacky/kalu.git

1b. If you cloned the repo, you'll have to prepare things :
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure

2. Go inside subfolder "po"

2b. If you cloned the repo, you'll have to generate kalu.pot :
    make kalu.pot

3. Create a new PO file for your locale using msginit :
    msginit
If you want to create a translation for another locale than your current one,
you'll simply have to use option -l, e.g. for French (fr) :
    msginit -l fr

4. Edit the generated .po file, translating each msgid in the corresponding
msgstr. (Also make sure to check the comments on top, including your name,
email, etc. It's also recommended to use UTF-8 as charset.)

5. Edit LINGUAS and add the language code (name of the .po file, without .po)
on a new line.

6. To test your translation, first make the .gmo file for your translation, e.g:
    make fr.gmo

Then you'll have to build & install kalu, as usual, just start it, and it
should speak your language. Note that if writing a translation for a locale
other than your current one, you'll have to specify it on launch, e.g:
    LANG=fr_FR.utf8 kalu
(Also note that you might have to re-generate your locales to include it.)

7. When you're satisfied your the translation, simply send it over to have it
included in the next release. You can :
    - Fork kalu of github and send a pull request; Or
    - Host the .po file somewhere and open an issue with a link; Or
    - Send me the file via email
